### A simple way to learn the functionality of REST and CRUD using Node.js and Mongodb

Background: I create this app from colt steele's tutorial within his web development bootcamp course. It taught me a lot about restful routing to a database so I want to explain what I did in as clear terms as possible. This repo also gives you a look a semantic UI (its fair to say i believe i prefer it to bootstrap). 


**What I learned:** 
<br>
REST, CRUD, SEMANTIC UI, MONGO/NoSQL Databases, EJS, MONGOOSE, BODY PARSER,** 

**1. Setup**
 
**2. RESTFUL Routes**

**3. Semantic UI**
